					<h3>Some Basic Design Principles we overlook</h3>
					<div class="entry-meta clearfix">
						<span>Jun 17, 2020</span>
					</div>
					<div class="entry-content">
						<p>A lot of my juniors, as well as my peers, have come up to me asking how they can improve
							their design while developing an app or a website since they are on their own and can't hire
							a designer for everything. Mostly I realized that I am giving out the same advice to all of
							them of course with some exceptions to the usage of my words, but the crux remains the same
							every time. Some of the Design Principles that I follow are pretty basic and can be applied
							by anyone be it a newbie or a professional person.
						<p>

						<p> Design principles are just fundamental pieces of advice to make easy-to-use, effective
							interfaces. You apply them when you select, create, and organize elements and features in
							your work. Design standards speak to the aggregated astuteness of specialists and experts in
							structure and related fields. At the point when you apply them, you can foresee how clients
							will probably respond to your plan. “KISS” (“Keep It Simple Stupid”) is a pretty basic
							principle where you design for non-experts and therefore minimize any confusion your users
							may experience.</p>
						<h3 class="entry-title">Always begin with User Research</h3>
						<p>But one of the most difficult tasks, when you look at design principles, is figuring out just
							how many design principles there are(3,6,10 the list goes on). But when you start designing
							and get into the practice of making them, you start learning that there are a few important
							things that you follow each time which helps a lot while making the designs. User experience
							design and User Interface Design are two yet not completely discovered fields in the
							industry. User experience deals with maximizing user satisfaction with any product, it
							includes Research, Building Wireframes, connecting dots, coming up with possible solutions.
							Whereas User interface deals with Making Prototypes, Building mockups, graphics, Placement
							of buttons, choosing right Colours, etc. To apply design principles effectively, you need to
							have a hold on users’ problems and a good eye for a possible solution.</p>
						<p>The first and foremost thing that you should do even before designing anything is to
							Research. Research is the key to an optimum user experience design. Research is what makes
							us understand the user, make a designer connected to the thoughts of the user. This step is
							all about knowing our system domain and brainstorming. Research is what, that’ll make the
							designer understand better, the problems, loopholes, flaws, etc. It also deals with studying
							the existing procedures or competitors and questioning them. One of the things I follow is
							to make user personas before I start working on the design, you judge how to guide the
							user’s eye using symmetry or asymmetry. In this way, I get to know a lot about the demands
							of the user which would help me follow a basic theme and build a solid UX.</p>
						<h3 class="entry-title">Design Principles</h3>
						<p>This list of basic principles can help anyone out there who is looking to build something out
							on their own or doesn’t want to hire a designer and wants to try designing out on their own.
						</p>
						<h3 class="entry-title">1. A bit of Contrast goes a long way</h3>
						<p>When dealing with clients I have heard them complaining so many times that the design needs
							to “pop” more. In designer terms, this is a very vague statement. But what the client wants
							is to have more contrast in the UI. This means that they want a distinctive distinction
							between the elements. For instance, they might want to have the text to display in an away
							that attracts the focus of the eye of the user. This can help improve the readability of
							texts as well. Emphasis on important texts attracts the attention of our brain
							automatically. Color contrast is a must while designing the UI as it gives us knowledge on
							how colors interact with each other. Insufficient contrast can make text content in
							particular very difficult to read, especially for people with visual impairments.</p>
						<img src="images/1.png" />
						<h3 class="entry-title">2. More the whitespace, cleaner the UI</h3>
						<p>This one I hold dear to myself and I like to follow in every design of mine. I read it in a
							book called “Whitespace is not your Enemy”. This really helped to improve my design a lot.
							The thing which attracts clients more is when the UI is clean, but at the same time, the
							client wants us to incorporate a ton of information on a single page. So what do you do
							then? Check this dashboard I designed and you’ll be able to make out a clean distribution of
							information. The bulk text will be placed in the challenges section as read more, this
							improves the look of the design.<br><br>One thing that you can do is to distribute your text
							sizes and placement in such a way that even a hundred lines text doesn’t look messy. One way
							of doing this is to open a pop-up for such large quantitative information. In this way, the
							information is on the same page, which satisfies the client and the UI is cleaner as well.
							When you have more whitespace the UI automatically looks neat and clean. White space does
							not literally mean an empty space with a white background. It can be text color, texture,
							shape, or even an image. Whitespace helps in improving the comprehension, it helps in making
							items stand out in the UI and bring attention to specific objects and much more.</p>

						<h3 class="entry-title">3. Gestalt’s law of Visual perception</h3>
						<p>This law seems fancy at first, but when you read into it, it’s basically just a law for
							things you know in the back of your mind but we sometimes overlook them in our designs. This
							law is related to how we as humans perceive things around us. It describes how humans
							typically see objects by grouping similar elements, recognizing patterns, and simplifying
							complex images. Designers use these to engage users via powerful -yet natural- “tricks” of
							perspective and best practice design standards.
							<br>
							<br>
							There are a bunch of laws under this principle, I would be elaborating on a few of them
							which I follow in almost every design of mine. I’ll leave a link for you to know more about
							them.
							<br>
							a) Law of proximity —This law basically states that elements that are grouped together are
							perceived to be related while those elements which are placed far apart are perceived as
							unrelated.
						</p>
						<img src="images/3.gif" />
						<p>Proximity is so powerful that it overrides similarity of color, shape, and other factors that
							might differentiate a group of objects.

							Notice the three groups of black and red dots above? The relative nearness of the objects
							has an even stronger influence on grouping than color does.
						</p>
						<p>b) Law of Similarity — This law states that when elements that are similar in shape, color,
							or size they are perceived to be together. This is a very important law since it helps us in
							deriving relationships between groups of elements. We seek differences and similarities in
							an image and link similar elements.</p>
						<img src="images/4.PNG" />
						<p>If someone looks at the image above, they will be able to see a square made up of shapes
							other than squares, also they would be able to see a diamond in between made up of circles
							even though it's not boundary marked. This is how our brain plays tricks on us and take the
							ambiguous visual information and organize it into something that makes sense to us —
							something familiar, orderly, symmetrical, and that we understand.
							<br>
							<br>
							c) law of closure — This law can be demonstrated almost everywhere around us. It states that
							our mind fills in blanks for objects that appear incomplete. It is visible in almost every
							interface that we see. If you notice the profile shape, it’s just two shapes placed together
							at close proximity but unconnected, but even then our mind automatically knows that its a
							shape of a person.
						</p>
						<h3 class="entry-title">4. Proportionate Your Design</h3>
						<p>This principle is one of the easier to understand. It is the Relative Sizing and Positioning
							of elements around the screen. Simply put, it’s the size of elements in relation to one
							another. It helps in bringing out what’s important and what’s not. Larger elements are more
							important, smaller elements less. This even helps the user understand the hierarchy of the
							elements. The relative positioning helps in bringing out relationships between the elements
							which helps in improving the UX to a great extent. It necessarily means that the user is
							able to understand the UI on his own. and is able to make out the different elements and
							their importance easily.</p>
						<img src="images/5.png" />
						<h3 class="entry-title">5. Always follow Basic Instincts</h3>
						<p>This just means that while designing it’s not necessary to follow a certain set of guidelines
							every time you are making something. The main reason being that every idea, every design is
							different in its own way, therefore, the same set of rules cant be followed every time. For
							instance, you don’t automatically use a 3:1 header-to-text weight ratio to abide by the
							principle of good hierarchy. That ratio is a standard rule. Instead, a guideline you might
							use to implement good hierarchy is “text should be easy to read”. You should use discretion
							whenever you apply design principles, e.g., you judge how to guide the user’s eye using
							symmetry or asymmetry. Consequently, you adapt the principles to each case and build solid
							experience as you address users’ needs over time.</p>
